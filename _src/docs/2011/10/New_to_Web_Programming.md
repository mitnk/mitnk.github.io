<p class="bodytext">If you're new to web programming, and aren't quite sure where to start, we've assembled some links to a selection of tutorials and reference materials on the web to help you out. There's a lot of great material out there, but we also know it's easy to get overwhelmed.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">At its most basic, programming for the HP webOS platform requires an understanding of HTML and JavaScript, two primary web components. HTML is used to set up the "<a href="/content/api/dev-guide/mojo/basics-scenes.html">scenes</a>" that you will see on the screen (which you can think of as being analogous to a web page), and JavaScript is used to control the behavior of those scenes. You will also need to understand the Document Object Model (DOM), which at its roots is a way to describe and reference parts of the scene you are working on. As you gain experience, you will also want to learn about Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), which allow you to customize the look and feel of web elements. 
</p>
<p class="bodytext">With that in mind, here are some places to start acquiring the skills and information you need: </p><ul class="def-list"><li>For some basic tutorials on HTML, JavaScript, DOM, and CSS, take a look at W3 schools. Their tutorials include a "Try it" section where you can modify code and see the results on the fly.<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank"><br>http://www.w3schools.com/</a></li>   <li>For more reference-oriented material, check out the Mozilla Developer Center.<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/" target="_blank"><br>https://developer.mozilla.org/En/</a></li>   <li>A solid understanding of JavaScript is crucial to building complex web applications. Doug Crockford, Yahoo!'s JavaScript architect, has a video lecture series at the YUI theater site that provides a good tutorial on key JavaScript concepts, and a history lesson to boot!<a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/" target="_blank"><br>http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/</a></li>  <li>For some deeper articles on Web authoring, have a look at IBM's developerWorks site.<a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/web/" target="_blank"><br>http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/web/</a></li>  <li>Net Tutorials has a wide range of practical articles that teach you how to do lots of cool things.<a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/" target="_blank"><br>http://net.tutsplus.com/</a></li>  <li>Sitepoint has some great practical example articles.<a href="http://articles.sitepoint.com/category/javascript/" target="_blank"><br>http://articles.sitepoint.com/category/javascript/</a></li>  </ul><p class="bodytext">We hope you'll find these links useful, and that they will start you down a rewarding path. Making apps is a lot of fun, and can be both personally and financially rewarding! </p>
