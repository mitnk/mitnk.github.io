Google Chrome is amazing. Light and fast, and release very often. Safari, the native of OS X, provide very good performance and experiences, especial the lovely  "Look Up" (double-tap with three fingers) feature (Even Chrome is support this on OS X). All of these are good for me to leave Firefox. But It didn't happen. I am still using Firefox the most time.

Reason I: Vimperator

Well, This used to be a reason why I cannot leave Firefox. But now the frequency of using it are not as higher as before. So it's become a bonus rather than a critical reason.

Reason II: Firebug

As a web developer, I am using Firebug a lot. Although Chrome also provide something similar. But I still feel Firebug is the better one.

Reason III: Proxy mechanism

This is a critical reason for me to continue using Firefox, when it relatively become heavy, slow, eat many of my memories, and can let me double-tab with three fingers while I am typing this article to determine whether a word is right or not. But the good thing is Firefox provide a better solution to deal with proxy stuff. Either AutoProxy or FoxyProxy, the mechanism to proxy is something like sandbox. The configures doesn't affect the net status of other places. Say I using proxy for all sites. Then the visiting to the Internet with Shell or other browsers will normal (not proxy as I set in Firefox). But Chrome or Safari, they use a quick way -- using the proxy of the OS (or Ubuntu and other systems) itself. This is very inconvenience since the sites I need to proxy is neither all or very few, it's just half-to-half. Well, this reason is pretty Chinese.

I am not only use Firefox. I using Safari either before encountering a site cannot open without proxy.

Happy in China.
