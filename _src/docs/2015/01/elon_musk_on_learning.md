Elon Musk 谈如何学习
===================

有人[在Reddit上](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2rgsan/i_am_elon_musk_ceocto_of_a_rocket_company_ama/cnfput4)问Elon Must是如何学得这么快这么多时。他说:

    I do kinda feel like my head is full! My context switching penalty is high and my process isolation is not what it used to be. Frankly, though, I think most people can learn a lot more than they think they can. They sell themselves short without trying. One bit of advice: it is important to view knowledge as sort of a semantic tree -- make sure you understand the fundamental principles, ie the trunk and big branches, before you get into the leaves/details or there is nothing for them to hang on to.

大概翻译下：

    我也觉得自己的脑子快要满了！我不同事情之间的切换和专注度不如我年轻时好了。
    其实，我认为多数人都能学比他以为的更多的东西。他们觉得他们学不了那么多
    所以早早放弃了。一点建议：把知识看到一棵树非常重要 -- 一定要掌握知识的基础本质，
    没有主干，树枝和树叶怎么能挂住呢。

Musk说的道理很简单，大概认识到和应用到日常生活不易吧。
