			<h1>RYB Color Picker</h1>
			<p>
				See <a href="http://daveeddy.com/2014/07/01/red-yellow-and-blue/">this blog post</a> for a detailed explanation of the desgin process of this color picker and algorithm
			</p>
			<h1>Computer and Printing Color Models</h1>
			<p>
				RGB, or red, green, and blue, are the primary colors of your computer, or more accurately your monitor.
				The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rgb">RGB color model</a> is an additive color model where red, greed, and blue lights are added together to
				create different colors.  All colors added together (<code>#ffffff</code>, or 100% red, 100% green, and 100% blue) will result in white.
			</p>
			<p>
				The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMYK_color_model">CMYK color model</a>, by contrast, is a subtractive color model
				using 3 colors, cyan, magenta, and yellow, and a 4th value for black.  All colors added together, because it is a subtractive color model,
				will result in black.  K, or black, is added for printing, as it easier (and cheaper) to attain a true black by not mixing all three other inks together.
				This color model is used typically for printing.
			</p>

			<h1>The RYB Color Model</h1>
			<p>
				The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RYB_color_model">RYB color wheel</a> uses red, yellow, and blue as the primary colors; this is the color model
				that is used for the <a href="./">RYB Color Picker</a>.  For details on how this model is rendered on the computer, so the <a href="#how">How</a> section below.
			</p>
			<h2>RYB vs RGB</h2>
			<p>
			Which one looks better?  The image on the right is a color wheel generated from the RGB color space, whereas the image on the left is run through the converter from RYB to RGB.

			<h1 id="how">How</h1>
			<p>
				Colors on a computer are typical seen as hex, such as <code>#ff00ff</code> which represnts purple;  Hex is used here a way of encoding RGB data (as explained above).
				To convert this to RYB, a conversion is done that may seem counter intuitive.  The color <code>#00ff00</code>, which represents 0% red, 100% green, and 0% blue in the
				RGB color space (green) becomes the color <code>#00ff00</code>, which represents 0% red, 100% yellow, 0% blue in the RYB color space (yellow).  We then, must convert that
				color, as it is given in RYB, to RGB.
			</p>
			<p>
				The conversion algorithm can be seen in <a href="https://github.com/bahamas10/ryb/blob/gh-pages/js/RXB.js#L252-L330">these lines of code</a>, and is also summed up in in this paper,
				<a href="assets/ryb.pdf">ryb.pdf</a> by Dr. Nathan Gossett and Dr. Baoquan Chen of the <a href="http://umn.edu">University of Minnesota at Twin Cities</a>
