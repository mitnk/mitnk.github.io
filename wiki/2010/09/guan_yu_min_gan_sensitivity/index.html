            <h2>1. Wiki上的Sensitivity (human)：</h2>
<p>The sensitivity or insensitivity of a human, often considered with regard to a particular kind of stimulus, is the strength of the feeling it results in, in comparison with the strength of the stimulus. The concept applies to physical as well as emotional feeling.</p>
<p>Sensitivity
   1. Rapid perception with the senses, reacting to small changes.
   2. Reacting appropriately to the emotions or situation of other people, tactful.
   3. A person with sensitive skin, which easily becomes painful or inflamed.
   4. A person believed to have paranormal or parapsychological perception.
   5. To be easily hurt or upset; to not take things for granted.</p>
<p>Insensitivity
   1. Not reacting to the emotions or situation of other people or not caring about others, tactless.
   2. Not reacting to something or not appreciating something.
   3. Not experiencing physical sensations, numb.</p>

<li>Wiki上的Sense：http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense#Pain
Pain
Nociception (physiological pain) signals near-damage or damage to tissue. The three types of pain receptors are cutaneous (skin), somatic (joints and bones) and visceral (body organs). It was previously believed that pain was simply the overloading of pressure receptors, but research in the first half of the 20th century indicated that pain is a distinct phenomenon that intertwines with all of the other senses, including touch. Pain was once considered an entirely subjective experience, but recent studies show that pain is registered in the anterior cingulate gyrus of the brain.</li>

<li>Wiki上的Feeling：
Feeling is the nominalization of "to feel". The word was first used in the English language to describe the physical sensation of touch  through either experience or perception. The word is also used to describe experiences, other than the physical sensation of touch, such as "a feeling of warmth".[1] In psychology, the word is usually reserved for the conscious subjective experience of emotion.[2] Phenomenology and heterophenomenology are philosophical approaches that provide some basis for knowledge of feelings. Many schools of psychotherapy  depend on the therapist achieving some kind of understanding of the client's feelings, for which methodologies exist. Some theories of interpersonal relationships also have a role for shared feelings or understanding of another person's feelings.[citation needed]

</ol>
<p>Perception of the physical world does not necessarily result in a universal reaction among receivers (see emotions), but varies depending on one's tendency to handle the situation, how the situation relates to the receiver's past experiences, and any number of other factors. Feelings are also known as a state of consciousness, such as that resulting from emotions, sentiments or desires.</p>
<p>Gut feeling</p>
<p>A gut feeling, or gut reaction, is a visceral emotional reaction to something, and often one of uneasiness. Gut feelings are generally regarded as not modulated by conscious thought, and as a reflection of intuition rather than rationality.</p>
<p>The phrase "gut feeling" may also be used as a short-hand term for an individual's "common sense" perception of what is considered "the right thing to do"; such as: helping an injured passerby, avoiding dark alleys and generally acting in accordance with instinctive feelings about a given situation. It can also refer to simple common knowledge phrases which are true no matter when said, such as "Water is wet", "Fire is hot", or to ideas that an individual intuitively regards as true, without proof (see "Truthiness" for examples).</p>
<p>Gut feelings, like all reflexive unconscious comparisons, can be re-programmed by practice or experience.</p>
